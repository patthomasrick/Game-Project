Our proposal for a game would be to make the player, who controls hang glider, 
fly through a cave littered with stalagmites and stalactites. As the player goes 
forward in the cave, the map moves accordingly. The player must navigate through 
the cave and try and get as far as possible in the cave. The hang glider is 
controlled by the mouse, and the position of the mouse controls where the player 
flies. The glider slowly changes its direction to go towards the mouse. Going up 
reduces the glider’s speed, and going down increases the speed. If the player were 
to go up for too long, the player would stall and fall. Crashing into the ceiling 
or floor would result in the player losing, and the distance that the player 
travelled would be his score.

If time would allow, a system of upgrades and high score saving would be added to
the program. The distance that the player would travel would correlate to the 
number of coins that the player would get. Coins would also float in the cave, 
and the player would be able to pick up said coins by flying over them. The 
upgrade system and bank would need a save game system. The save system would 
also allow for the saving of high scores, allowing you to see how you compete 
against others on the same computer. Additionally, the color of the hang glider 
would be able to be customized. You can also buy smoke trails and other 
customizations for your hang glider with the currency that you collect.
